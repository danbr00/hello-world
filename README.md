# Hello World!

This is my Hello World. 

I am testing setting up a Github repository, hopefully it will be the first of many projects.

I am a big fan of R programming, the RStudio IDE and packages like ggplot2/Shiny/knitr and maybe RRO. I have most experience in scientific programming, data analysis and visualisation and R provides me with all these capabilities and it's free!
